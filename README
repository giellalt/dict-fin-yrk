These files have been automatically generated from main/langs/yrk/src/morphology/stems/...xml files with a simple xslt written by Jack Rueter
The content is intended for use with nds dictionaries in http://vada.oahpa.no .
The automatically generated reverse-direction dictionary may be useful in
the location of problems within the yrk-project, but it is also helpful
for bridging an initial fin-yrk communication awareness.
The yrk transducer is in its second year of development in a Kone Foundation funded project
The fin transducer is from OMorFi
